# tidyxml
Python script to sort XML attributes based on their name

So the order of XML attributes does not matter. But it does matter if you put it under version control. Therefore it is very useful to be able to sort the attributes of an XML file based on their name.

# Usage
```
./tidyxml.py input.xml output.xml
```
